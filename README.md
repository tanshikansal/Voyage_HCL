# Voyage_Tourism_Guide
VOYAGE is a tourism guidance system made for a mini-project based internship in HCL.
VOYAGE allows the user to choose the city of interest from the list of cities or categories to gain knowledge on the famous tourist's spots at the chosen city helping them to plan out their trip to the city.
For now, the website consists of 12 cities in total divided into three categories:
1. Beach (Andaman, Goa, Pondicherry)
2. Hills (Coorg, Darjeeling, Kodaikanal, Mussoorie, Ooty, Shimla)
3. Historical (Agra, Jaipur, Mysore)
